 #  Pet Expenses Analysis Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project is a **personal finance analytics tool** designed to track, categorize, and visualize the costs associated with pet ownership. 

As a Physics student transitioning into Data Science, I applied analytical principles to a real-world problem: understanding the financial impact of owning different types of pets (Rabbits vs. Dog) over time.
